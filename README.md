Number Sort

Number Sort is a page the generates random numbers from 0 to 99 and then inserts them into "sorting table" in the DOM.  The app then uses the array.prototype.sort method to sort the numbers from lowest to highest or highest to lowest based on user input.  The amount of numbers that are initally generated is based on user input from 0 - 999.
